Project Title: College Life - Choose Your Own Adventure Game
Date of Presentation: December 5, 2023

This is a C++ program that allows a person to choose different options to progress in a simple aerospace student simulation. The program only allows one person to play at a time.

All the files necessary to run the program are included.

To run the program, unzip the provided folder and open this zip file. To start the program open the "insert_solution_file_name_here.sln" in Microsoft Visual Studios. Then click the 'Local Windows Debugger' button at the upper right to start. 

The program will first ask for the player's first name (without a space) and then will allow the play to choose aircraft or spacecraft route. This is the very start and will allow the plaayer to make different choice depending on the already chosen choices.

If the player does not follow the input directions the program may crash, so please pay close attention.
